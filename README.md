# CxxPrimerPlus

This is my implementation of the exercises in the book 'C++ Primer Plus'.

Chapter 1-8 were based on 5 edition, and chapter 9-18 were based on 6 edition.

All source codes were developed using emacs and compiled by g++ 4.1.2 in CentOS (2.6.18-128.e15PAE), g++ 4.2.1 in Mac OS X 10.6.8/10.7.3 or g++ 4.6.1 in Windows 7 SP1.
