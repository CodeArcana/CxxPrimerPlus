# CxxPrimerPlus

This is my implementation of the exercises in the book 'C++ Primer Plus'.


All source codes were developed using emacs and compiled by g++ 4.1.2 in CentOS (2.6.18-128.e15PAE).

# Chapter 2 SETTING OUT TO C++  (2012-01-06, Fri)

	1. Write a C++ program that displays your name and address.
	2. Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards. 
	(One furlong is 220 yards.)
	3. Write a C++ program that uses three user-defined functions (counting main() as one)
	and produces the following output:
		Three blind mice
		Three blind mice
		See how they run
		See how they run
	One function, called two times, should produce the first two lines, and the remaining
	function, also called twice, should produce the remaining output.
	4. Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a Celsius
	temperature value as an argument and then returns the equivalent Fahrenheit value. The
	program should request the Celsius value as input from the user and display the result,
	as shown in the following code:
		Please enter a Celsius value: 20
		20 degrees Celsius is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
	For reference, here is the formula for making the conversion:
		Fahrenheit = 1.8 x degrees Celsius + 32.0
	5. Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a distance
	in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in astronomical units. 
	The program should request the light year value as input from the user and display 
	the result, as shown in the following code:
		Enter the number of light years: 4.2
		4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.
	An astronomical unit is the average distance from the earth to the sun (about
	150,000,000 km or 93,000,000 miles), and a light year is the distance light travels 
	in a year (about 10 trillion kilometers or 6 trillion miles). (The nearest star after
	the sun is about 4.2 light years away.) Use type double (as in Listing 2.4) 
	and this conversion factor:
		1 light year = 63,240 astronomical units
	6. Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a minute value. 
	The main() function should then pass these two values to a type void function 
	that displays the two values in the format shown in the following sample run:
		Enter the number of hours: 9
		Enter the number of minutes: 28
		Time: 9:28
